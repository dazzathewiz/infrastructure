# A few notes in the setup of the portainer container role and admin password
# - I wanted to automate the provision of the admin password from Ansible secrets
# - The portainer docker has a couple of methods for setup of admin password:
#   - https://docs.portainer.io/v/ce-2.6/advanced/cli 
# - I couldn't get the hash password method working after much troubleshooting EG:
#   - https://gist.github.com/deviantony/62c009b41bde5e078b1a7de9f11f5e55
#   - I tried getting a docker output using httpd:2.4-alpine image (couldn't get output)
#   - I tried installing apache2-utils for htpasswd use with shell script
#   - Even when getting the hash, trying escaping chars etc, the admin login never worked with correct password
# - This role now uses the file method, which puts the password in plain text file with root only permissions
